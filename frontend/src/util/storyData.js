	<p>Are you interested in applying for the NUS Student Exchange Programme (SEP), but are unsure of the application process?</p>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">My name is Min Han, and I will be breaking down the NUS SEP \
	application process into 6 simple steps. I will be covering what I went through, as well as the \
	documents I had to prepare as a NUS CHBE student, which I feel should be similar for other \
	courses. If you are from a different faculty, you may want to check with your seniors or \

	<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Step 0:       Check the application period</h4>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Before you begin, you need to know when your SEP application \

	<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Step 2:       Write up about yourself</h4>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is the easy part. Fill in all your personal information\
	: CCAs, awards, academic history and others. You will also need to write a Statement of Purpose\
	(up to 1000 words I believe), including why you feel that you should be allowed to be an ambassador\
	of NUS for SEP or other information which you feel are relevant.</p>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On this same page, you can start with step 3 as well.</p>\
	<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Step 3:       Fill in your top 5 choices</h4>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During this application period, you should receive\
	a list stating the number of vacancies at the different possible partner school choices from NUS\
	International Relations Office (IRO). You are required to fill up your top 5 school choices from\
	this list and the period that you intend to head for exchange Eg Aalto University (Finland),\
	Semester 1. Of these 5 choices, at least 3 must be on different continents. For each of your choices\
	, you then need to list out the modules you plan to take and the corresponding NUS module that you wish\
	to map it to.</p>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I would say this is the hardest part of the application as you will\
	spend a lot of time researching about each school and the modules that they offer. I would\
	strongly suggest that you do not procrastinate on this step. Set aside enough time (at least 1 week)\
	to contemplate about your school choices. If you&#8217;re overwhelmed, take things slowly and work\
	your way down the list provided. You can even ask for seniors for recommendations of popular school choices\
	.</p>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thankfully, at this point you do not need to a definite list of all the\
	modules you want to study yet but try your best to find as many mappable modules as possible.</p>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Important things to research about your SEP school include:</p>\
	<ul>\
	<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The school&#8217;s ranking for your course</li>\
	<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">Possible modules for mapping. Make sure these modules\
	are available during the intended semester of exchange. Just because the school offers that modules does not mean\
	that it is offered for the entire year.</li>\
	<li style=\"text-align: justify;\">The situation and status of the city and country of your school.</li>\
	</ul>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though every choice is important, try to spend more time contemplating and\
	planning for your first and second choices. These are the ones that you must be most well-versed in to talk\
	about when you head for your SEP interview (if any).</p>\
	<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Step 4:       Prepare your documents</h4>\
	<p>There are 3 documents that NUS CHBE students are required to submit before heading for SEP. These are our study plan,\
	mappable module description list and module road map. If you have the time, try to prepare them all during\
	the planning stages as it will help you in deciding your school choice.</p>\
	<ol>\
	<li><strong>Study Plan</strong>\
	<ul>\
	<li>This first document is to be submitted online under additional documents, or to your department if they request for it. <strong>You need to prepare a rough study plan first while doing your application.</strong></li>\
	<li>It is the tentative list of modules (both NUS and partner school) that you plan to map. Modules listed here can still be changed any time, even while you are already in SEP.</li>\
	<li>When preparing this, I highly recommend that you find at least find 5 mappable modules (maybe 7 or so) for your chosen schools and within the period of exchange. This gives you some backup options as well. If your intended partner school only has 4 mappable modules or less, you may wish to reconsider it.</li>\
	</ul>\
	</li>\
	</ol>\
	<ol start=\"2\">\
	<li><strong>Mappable Module Description</strong>\
	<ul>\
	<li><strong>This document can be done later after the results are out</strong> and you have been assigned an SEP partner school.</li>\
	<li>It is a full list of all modules (both intended and backup options) that you potentially could take while on exchange in your partner university. It includes full descriptions about the NUS modules and the corresponding mapped partner university modules that you can find from both universitiesâ€™ websites such as number of hours, module content etc to show that the modules are similar enough. You are then required to submit this list to your department to request for mapping approval.</li>\
	<li>Ultimately when you go for SEP, you are only allowed to choose modules which are within this list. If the information found is insufficient or the modules too dissimilar, it may be rejected and you may need to email to request for more information or seek other modules.</li>\
	<li><strong>I strongly advise you to find as many modules as possible</strong>. The information that you find will likely be outdated as you are probably preparing this one year in advance. It is possible that a module that you wanted to take becomes unavailable when you head for your own SEP. This could be due to discontinuation of module, insufficient students or other reasons.</li>\
	<li>If you find a new module that you want to map while on exchange which is not in this list, you have to request for approval again.</li>\
	<li>Note that when seeking approval, you may need to approach other departments if those modules are not within the control of your department. This may be a long lengthy procedure, so best to start it early.</li>\
	</ul>\
	</li>\
	</ol>\
	<ol start=\"3\">\
	<li><strong>Road Map</strong>\
	<ul>\
	<li><strong>This document can be done later after the results are out</strong> and you have been assigned an SEP partner school.</li>\
	<li>It is an excel sheet which summarises all the modules which you have taken or will be taking every semester throughout your education curriculum. It helps you to plan and ensure that you fulfill all important modules and prerequisites as well as graduation requirements.</li>\
	<li>I included my own road map in my file collection. You may not be able to completely refer to my road map (or other seniors) as there have been many changes throughout the batches. If youâ€™re interested to read up on these changes, I have included <a href=\"https://whyamiinchemeng.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/comparison-of-academic-batches/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://whyamiinchemeng.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/comparison-of-academic-batches/', 'here');\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> a comparison between the different CHBE academic batches. Please read up on your courseâ€™s recommended schedule so that you donâ€™t miss out on anything needed for graduation!</li>\
	</ul>\
	</li>\
	</ol>\
	<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Step 5:       Head for your SEP interview (if any)</h4>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some faculties like NUS School of business do not have this segment. However NUS CHBE does!</p>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is a small group interview of up to 3 interviewees and 3 interviewers, and lasts for 10-15 minutes. Within this interview, they will ask 3-5 questions for the group to answer. These questions have a wide range of topics, such as describing about yourself and past experiences, about your educational curriculum or about your SEP choices. You can find a list of sample SEP interview questions <a href=\"https://whyamiinchemeng.wordpress.com/2016/07/18/sep-interview/\" onclick=\"__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://whyamiinchemeng.wordpress.com/2016/07/18/sep-interview/', 'here');\">here</a>.</p>\
	<h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Step 6:       Pray</h4>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">And you&#8217;re done! That is all there is to it and hopefully you will get your top choice! (:. If you don&#8217;t, fret not. There is always round 2 (and maybe round 3), but only with the remaining vacancies that have yet to be taken.</p>\
	<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">SEP really is a wonderful experience, so I hope that this simple guide has been helpful to whoever needs it (:.</p>\"",

	"title": "10 essential steps to a successful exchange application",
	"content": "<p>In less than a month, the 3 of us leave for Warsaw, Poland. Trust me, this whole upcoming exchange still feels really surreal to us and it&#8217;s not just because we are heading to Poland but also that&#8230;.  the three of us are all heading <strong>together to the same city in the same country</strong>.</p>\
<p>We hope this (condensed) post is able to help those attempting to go together as well! Since we really did go through quite a bit in our case of application and think it was appropriate to begin our new blog with <em>how it all started. </em></p>\
<p><em>Note: This experience is of an SMU student, do research and find out what your university does differently.</em></p>\
<ol>\
<li><strong> Choose <u>when</u> you wish to embark on exchange</strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>There are pros and cons of going in each semester.</p>\
<p>Generally, in SMU, the <strong>first semester</strong> of the year is always more popular in SMU. Why? Because you have the summer for an internship and to travel thereafter, but youâ€™d also be there in the beginning of winter where your day gets terribly short. (But that would happen later in your travel!)</p>\
<p>Applying in the <strong>second semester</strong> may or may not eat into your internship dates (depending on the country and its exam dates so do find out if you are attempting to go during the second semester AND plan on going on internship), but the weather does get warmer (later in your travel) and you have the entire summer to travel, if you donâ€™t have plans to intern.</p>\
<p>Also, decide when in your 4 years/3.5 years you want to embark on exchange. As part of SMU requirements, you can&#8217;t go for exchange on your last semester (boohoo to living a high life right till graduation).  Furthermore, you donâ€™t want to go on exchange too early and come back and have 2 more long years of school left right? Varying opinions on this but letâ€™s get started.</p>\
<ol start=\"2\">\
<li><strong> Choose <u>who</u>you want to travel with </strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>This is a very important step so choose wisely. Personally, the three of us have travelled together before, on more than a few occasions. We liked it. And it worked for us (for now at least).</p>\
<p>You have to understand that embarking on a 6 month long exchange will mean you guys will literally be living together all the time (of course depending on how much time you guys spend apart meeting other people from other countries), but this is your <em>family</em> for the duration of your exchange. It is very important to align your priorities and if not, learn to compromise. Learn and know about each otherâ€™s travelling style, and think hard if it suits you.</p>\
<ol start=\"3\">\
<li><strong> Roughly map your modules </strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>You should know what you <em>need</em> to clear and what you <em>can </em>clear in each country/city.</p>\
<p>This step is incredibly difficult for an Accountancy student planning to clear Accounting Options, like I am. If you are a business or economics student, or an accountancy student not planning to clear AOs, this step is relatively easy.</p>\
<p>Hereâ€™s how you go about doing it.</p>\
<p>In SMU, the first step is to check out the course catalog of what previous students have cleared in each university. Your university may have something similar. The next step is to proceed to the host universityâ€™s website and see if those modules you plan to clear are offered in your semester of exchange. This is because the course catalog is merely what every student who went to that university cleared, it may or may not be offered in your semester, or there may be other newer modules you can clear under the various electives offered not documented in the course catalog. So in-depth research has to be done at this stage. It will take a lot of time so be mentally prepared.</p>\
<ol start=\"4\">\
<li><strong> Create a common excel sheet </strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>Now, be realistic. Bear in mind, it may be impossible for all of you to get into the exact same university. Youâ€™d be lucky to be in the same country, much less same city. So do your research and see what works for you. At this stage, youâ€™d be eliminating universities/cities/countries/regions that donâ€™t work in terms of module mapping. For example, I really wanted to clear an AO and no university in Asia offered that as far as the course catalog went (except Hong Kong which I put as my absolute last back up), so I eliminated Asia and focused on Europe and Latin America. This brings me to the next stage.</p>\
<ol start=\"5\">\
<li><strong> Discuss the region you&#8217;d prefer to be in</strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>Now youâ€™d have to have an open discussion with the region youâ€™re comfortable with travelling, and where youâ€™d prefer to be in.</p>\
<p>Economically speaking Eastern Europe is much cheaper than Western Europe, as Latin America is cheaper than North America. Of course the downside is how dangerous it is perceived to be. Its highly likely that youâ€™d have different risk appetites, so already at this stage compromise comes in. Also, Eastern Europe is also considered to be more popular and harder to get in. People told us 3 friends going to Warsaw together is almost impossible (since even one getting in is hard enough), given we arenâ€™t dean-listers or anything in that realm.</p>\
<p>Also, if youâ€™d prefer to be in the same region, your first few choices shouldnâ€™t be from different regions. So if you donâ€™t already know, the exchange university youâ€™re allocated to is based on your GPA, then your CCAâ€™s etc. Unless you and your friend(s) have the exact same GPA, one is going to be higher than the rest. We found out the hard way, we put Peru as our second choice and Warsaw as the first. I missed Warsaw and got Peru, and it was in a whole another region such that travelling together would be impossible.</p>\
<ol start=\"6\">\
<li><strong> Choosing the university</strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>Of course, if you wish to apply to the same few universities, you have got to check the intake of each university.</p>\
<p>Now hereâ€™s the dilemma â€“ universities with large numbers of intake, Iâ€™m talking 7 or more (there are universities that take in 10 or 15 even), are very popular, because of course people want to travel with their friends. On the other hand, universities in pretty popular countries like Germany, France that have an intake of 1 or even 2 are much less popular. I think maybe many Singaporeans are afraid to be too far from other Singaporeans. So this is a tricky step.</p>\
<p>Itâ€™s okay to be in a different university. So since there were 2 universities (that partnered with SMU) in Warsaw â€“ Warsaw School of Economics (WSE) and Kozminski (KOZ), the former with an intake of 10 and the latter an intake of 2, we maximized our options. Since 2 of us could not map enough modules in KOZ, Felicia put that as her top choice, WSE as her 2<sup>nd</sup>. This at least helped us get some leeway, and the 2 of us would be competing with one less person in WSE. This worked, she got KOZ and Melrose got WSE.</p>\
<ol start=\"7\">\
<li><strong> Have back-ups </strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>Youâ€™d be lucky to be in the same city as the friend you hope to embark on exchange with. So have back ups. Donâ€™t just drop out of the race just because you guys have no other universities that work for all of you. Use all the 7 choices you got. This was the way for us, we only synchronised the first 3 or 4 choices, the rest were our back ups that weâ€™d be happy to go, just that we wouldnâ€™t be together.</p>\
<p>We knew we definitely wanted to go on exchange, even if we werenâ€™t travelling together. Travelling together was just a nice bonus.</p>\
<ol start=\"8\">\
<li><strong> Apply for exchange and pray</strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>Cross your fingers and pray people somehow didn&#8217;t like the country/university/culture you are dying to go for.</p>\
<p>It doesnâ€™t take more than 3 weeks for the exchange results to come out and in that time, consider step 9.</p>\
<ol start=\"9\">\
<li><strong> Consider applying directly to universities </strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>I guess this is the golden step. After applying, youâ€™d get some idea of what were the popular destinations, and if your friends were applying as well, who you roughly knew where their GPA stood against yours, you might have to consider applying directly. This is what I did.</p>\
<p>After Melrose and Felicia secured a spot in Warsaw, I began another round of in-depth research and wrote to schools in Warsaw to find out if they would accept guest students for one semester. A key thing to note at this stage â€“ the university cannot be already partnered with SMU and be offered as an exchange university.</p>\
<p><strong><em>(skip step 10 if you&#8217;re like 11/10 sure that you will get the university you applied for)</em></strong></p>\
<ol start=\"10\">\
<li><strong> Applying directly to universities </strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>I feel people haven&#8217;t considered this step because they do not really know much (<em>what&#8217;s the procedure like, what are the risks,etc) </em>about it.</p>\
<p>You and all your friends can consider doing this together because the host university <strong>doesnâ€™t always have a quota</strong> like partner universities with SMU, as long as your fill in their application form.</p>\
<p>Theyâ€™d be happy to have you provided you meet their conditions. The great thing about it is, youâ€™d have to take an LOA, meaning you donâ€™t pay school fees. Saving over $5,000++. Now depending on where youâ€™re applying to, youâ€™d pay the university directly. A friend of mine applied to Finland and school fees were waived for guest students. For me, I pay 40+ EUR per ECT per module, which cumulatively is still way cheaper than the $5,000. Depending on your region, your school fees may be cheaper or more expensive than you pay at SMU, and either ways youâ€™d have to bear the entire cost. Of course, the drawback is you canâ€™t really apply for any exchange scholarships as to do so you need to be going to a university partner. So I hope that breaks it down for you</p>\
<ol>\
<li><strong> The first step is getting accepted into the university</strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>So at this stage, apply to as many as you can. SMU can only approve one self-arranged exchange application, and if accepted by SMU but rejected by that university, I donâ€™t think you can do the same process with another university in the same semester. So make sure you are accepted first, by the host university. Donâ€™t worry here usually the timeframe of application is longer than SMUâ€™s and you will have enough time to apply and get accepted if you start doing so immediately after the results of your exchange universities are out. In your application, you may need several documents or signatures from SMU. Your liaison will be your school, so SOB SOA etc.  Go to the undergraduate office and theyâ€™d help you out.</p>\
<ol>\
<li><strong> The second step is  SMUâ€™s approval of adding this university in as a self-arranged international exchange </strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p><em>(assuming you are successful in getting accepted into the university of the city of your choice)</em></p>\
<p>Youâ€™d have to provide accreditations and rankings of the university to get it accepted, itâ€™d be best if it has the accreditations SMU has. You can find this through basic research on the host universityâ€™s website.</p>\
<p>Two universities that I know have been accepted by SMU include:</p>\
<p>University of Warsaw, Poland</p>\
<p>University of Oulu, Finland</p>\
<ol>\
<li><strong> The third step is module mapping</strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p><em>(If youâ€™re lucky and youâ€™re accepted by both SMU and the host university)</em></p>\
<p>Youâ€™d have an online worksheet and youâ€™d have to supply SMU with the module syllabus. Unlike a normal international exchange, the number of credit hours in your host university per module is used to translate back to your CUs.</p>\
<p>In SMU, 19 hours or more = 0.5CU. 39 hours or more = 1 Cu.</p>\
<p>In the online worksheet you only get 10 options, but do not fret, you can speak to your undergraduate officer to remove the rejected ones and apply again.</p>\
<ol>\
<li><strong> The fourth step is to secure these modules that you can map back to your home university</strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>This shouldnâ€™t be a problem, depending on how flexible your university is.</p>\
<ol>\
<li><strong>The last step is of course surviving the semester and get your preparations down to head over there for exchange!</strong></li>\
</ol>\
<p>Now, of course travelling with friends has its pros and cons, some hate it because you cling with Singaporeans instead of going out there and meeting others local to the countries, other travelers, other exchange students. The great thing about this plan and how it worked us for us though, is that we 3 are in the same city, with each university not being more than an hour away from the other, but yet being in different universities, it gives us space to interact with other locals and exchange students!</p>\
<p>We hope this little guide helps!</p>\
